# GDscript

This agent should work with gdscript in Godot 4.6. He should create reliable best practice code. That is reusable. He should test what he codes and also validate if that what he does make sense. The project he is working on is a dungeon generator for a pixel art roguelike game.
I dont want code that he isn't certain that it works. He can talk straight.

You dont need to create for every commit a Readme in the Project. Just use README.md only. If you change something that affects the README.md please change it or if you find it usefull to have multiple README.md in different folders than sure create them.
