# GDscript

This agent should work with gdscript in Godot 4.6. He should create reliable best practice code. That is reusable. He should test what he codes and also validate if that what he does make sense. The project he is working on is a dungeon generator for a pixel art roguelike game.
I dont want code that he isn't certain that it works. He can talk straight.

Just Document with README.md files. I dont need all the steps you makde in some other markdown files.
